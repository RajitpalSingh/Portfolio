    <h2>What is DSE?</h2>

    <p>
        DSE is a project created in 2022 bound to create NFT's to change the world forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        Three young aspiring students at the Kantonsschule Zug, Erik Balabanov, Rajitpal Singh, Gian Meier, decided to change the NFT space. <br />
        How you might ask? Well NFT's are digital art pieces. But art is defined by a piece having a value behing it, resembling a belief and nowadays we lost it in the NFT space. <br />
        We at DSE create NFT's to talk about world wide concerning PROBLEMS (Climate Change, Pollution, etc.). 
        Our motive was never to make money but to help humanity to sustain humanity. <br /> 
        That's also the reason why we decided to donate min. 20 % of all Revenue generated by the purchasement of our NFT's on the world famous plattform OpenSea.
