    <h1>Educational Qualifications</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>As I was born and brought up here in Switzerland, my parents decided that I go to the local excellent public school. <br /></p>
    <p>Now a public school doesn't sound as excusite as a private school and honestly one is partly true but Switzerland ... <br/>has one of the BEST Educational Systems.</p> 
    <p>So local schools here are built on a solid infrastructure and tons of support from the government.<br/> </p>
    <p>And yes, in Switzerland every 8th person is a millionaire, so yes, public schools can make you a millionaire</p>
